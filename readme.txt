README:
1. Run and Compile:
    1.1. Complie : make

    1.2. Execute : ./MAJNAR <input file>  (Note that the input file should be the same directory as the program)
    p.s.1 you can edit your own batch file for running the specific experiment efficiently
    p.s.2 currently the input file only supports in Verilog format

    1.3 every time when you excute the file, there will be a file called "EXP_table.v", which records the informations of the resultant circuit

2. Details in the Program:
    1.1 see the macros in NodeMGR.cpp, there are several parameters can use, including
        MAREUSE:     Perform MA Reuse technique
        SIMPLIFY:    Simplify the circuits
        NODEAR:      Perform NAR algorithm
        MAX_FANOUTS: Max fanouts restriction  

    1.2 see the macros in NodeAR.cpp, there are several parameters can use, including
        SIMPLIFY:       Simplify the circuits
        DEPTHPRESERVED: Perform depth preservation for NAR algorithm

3. Benchmarks:
    MIG benchmarks generated by Luca Amaru 

Hope these help!
